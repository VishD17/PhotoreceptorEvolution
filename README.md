# Summary

This repository contains code written to analyze single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 7 different species. Pre-processing follows the Scanpy v1.9.3 workflow and the Seurat algorithm is used for cross-species integration. Cow and Human data were directly analyzed in R; hence they do not have individual Jupter Notebook files.
